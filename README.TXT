This is version 3 of the TEI-EMACS installation: a more or less
complete SGML/XML authoring system, which combines GNU-Emacs
with PSGML and a host of other relevant emacs customizations for
writing and validating SGML or XML documents. Most XML-emacs subsystems
have their own help system or documentation.

The systems included here are all distributed under the terms of the 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (see the file info/COPYING). Individual
components also carry their own README files, which should be read for
further information.

This package includes SGML and XML DTDs and stylesheets for the latest
available versions of the TEI DTDs (TEI P4, published May 2002) and
also of other popular DTDs (Docbook, XHTML). Select the DTD you want
from the DTD menu.

This package was put together by 

 Lou Burnard (lou.burnard@oucs.ox.ac.uk) 
 Sebastian Rahtz (sebastian.rahtz@oucs.ox.ac.uk)
 Christian Wittern (wittern@kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp)

and is available from the TEI web site at
