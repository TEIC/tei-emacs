<p>Now you should have a look at an SGML document with <span class=
"APPLICATION">PSGML</span>. We'll start with a very simple example
provided by Paul Prescod's DSSSL introduction (see <a href=
"cygx736.html">Further Reading</a>). This example does not use an
external DTD. The necessary files to resolve links to external DTDs
will be added later. There is no need to understand the syntax of
the DTD at the moment, simply type it or copy it to your
document.</p>

<p>Restart <span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span> to apply the
latest changes to your <tt class="FILENAME">_emacs</tt> and open a
new SGML document: Type <b class="COMMAND">C-x C-f ~/test.sgml</b>
to create the document <tt class="FILENAME">test.sgml</tt> in your
home directory (you may as well type the full path of a file in any
other convenient directory). <span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span>
should load the <span class="APPLICATION">PSGML</span> mode (check
the minibuffer in the last line of the <span class=
"APPLICATION">Emacs</span> frame). Now type or paste the following
DTD into the new buffer:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
      
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTMLLite [
      &lt;!ELEMENT HTMLLite O O (H1|P)* &gt;
      &lt;!ELEMENT (H1|P) - - (#PCDATA|EM|STRONG)* &gt;
      &lt;!ELEMENT (EM|STRONG) - - (#PCDATA) &gt;
      ]&gt;
      
   
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As you just have created the DTD, <span class=
"APPLICATION">PSGML</span> is not yet aware of it (when you load an
existing SGML file, <span class="APPLICATION">PSGML</span> will
automatically parse the DTD due to a setting in our <tt class=
"FILENAME">_emacs</tt> file). Press <b class="COMMAND">C-c C-p</b>
to parse the DTD now. Check your DTD again if <span class=
"APPLICATION">PSGML</span> issues an error.</p>

<p>Now place the cursor at the end of the buffer and start to
append the contents of the document to the prolog. Use the menu
command <span class="GUIMENU">Markup</span>-&gt;<span class=
"GUIMENUITEM">Insert Element</span> to enter the first element. You
will notice that <span class="APPLICATION">PSGML</span> offers only
one possible element to insert: <span class=
"MARKUP">HTMLlite</span>. Accept this and insert another element
right where you are. This time you will see that you can either
insert a <span class="MARKUP">H1</span> or a <span class=
"MARKUP">P</span> element. You can enter some text between the
<span class="MARKUP">H1</span> or <span class="MARKUP">P</span>
start and end tags. Try to insert another element when the cursor
is inside the text in a <span class="MARKUP">H1</span> or <span
class="MARKUP">P</span> element. This will allow you to insert
either a <span class="MARKUP">STRONG</span> or an <span class=
"MARKUP">EM</span> element, which again can hold some text. Try
also the keyboard shortcut for inserting an element, <b class=
"COMMAND">C-c C-e</b>. You will be prompted for the name of an
element. Either enter the full name of an element, the first
letters and then the tab key, or simply press the tab key twice to
see a list of possible tags at the given location. Note that you
don't have to enter hard returns or to manually indent, PSGML takes
care of this.</p>

<p>When you're done, save your document by pressing <b class=
"COMMAND">C-c C-s</b>. A valid HTMLlite document may look like
this:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
      
&lt;htmllite&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Character of Constantine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person, as well as the mind, of Constantine had been enriched by nature
with her choicest endowments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His stature was &lt;em&gt;lofty&lt;/em&gt;, his countenance &lt;em&gt;majestic&lt;/em&gt;, his
deportment &lt;em&gt;graceful&lt;/em&gt;; his strength and activity were displayed in
every manly exercise, and, from his earliest youth to a very advanced season
of life, he preserved the vigour of his constitution by a
&lt;strong&gt;strict&lt;/strong&gt; adherence to the domestic virtues of chastity and
temperance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/htmllite&gt;
      
   
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You should also have noticed that <span class=
"APPLICATION">PSGML</span> performs syntax-highlighting: Start/end
tags and other language-related constructs are shown in different
colors to increase readability. Do not delete your test document
yet, because you may wish to reuse it in the next chapter.</p>
