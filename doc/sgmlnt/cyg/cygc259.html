<font color="RED">The all-purpose text editor and kitchen
sink</font>
<p><span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span> is the core component of
the SGML system. Due to its configurability and extensibility it
will be the SGML document editor and front-end to all related
applications, just like an IDE for a programming language. <span
class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span> is completely different from most
other text editors in that it is basically a Lisp interpreter
implemented in C and a whole bunch of Lisp files, which add most of
the functionality.</p>

<p><span class="APPLICATION">NTEmacs</span> is a port of <span
class="APPLICATION">GNU Emacs</span> for the 32bit Windows
platforms. The user interface retains most of the features of its
Unix counterpart, so it takes some time to get used to it for the
average <span class="APPLICATION">MS Word</span> user. However,
there are quite a few tutorials and an extremely helpful reference
card for the most important commands to get started quickly. There
are some important things that you should know right now to
understand what is happening during the installation below.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span> is installed in a set of
directories which will be automatically created when unpacking the
archive. The <tt class="FILENAME">\bin</tt> subdirectory holds the
executables. The <tt class="FILENAME">\lisp</tt> subdirectory holds
all the Emacs Lisp code which turns <span class=
"APPLICATION">Emacs</span> into what it is. The <tt class=
"FILENAME">\site-lisp</tt> subdirectory is a nice place for the
configuration files <tt class="FILENAME">site-start.el</tt> and <tt
class="FILENAME">default.el</tt> (see below).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span> is configured by a set of
startup files. As <span class="APPLICATION">Windows NT</span> is a
multi-user system just like Unix, there are system-wide
configuration files as well as user configuration files. When Emacs
is started, it first reads a file called <tt class=
"FILENAME">site-start.el</tt>. This file is meant to hold all the
system-wide configuration data that users may override by their
personal configuration files. It next reads the personal
configuration file <tt class="FILENAME">_emacs</tt> of the current
user (NTEmacs also accepts the Unix-style <tt class=
"FILENAME">.emacs</tt>, but you should be aware that files with a
leading dot may be ignored by file-handling software like backup
utilities, thus giving a new meaning to the leading dot as a hiding
attribute on Unix systems). This file should contain personal
modifications like color schemes, mail- or newsserver configuration
or code to load specialized packages that other users on the system
don't need. Finally it reads the file <tt class=
"FILENAME">default.el</tt>, which can be used for code that users
normally should not be allowed to override. If <span class=
"APPLICATION">Emacs</span> doesn't find any of these files, it
starts up with sensible defaults which allow to access the basic
functionality (and this is more than you'd expect).</p>

<p>As the built-in <span class="GUIMENU">Help</span>-&gt;<span
class="GUIMENUITEM">Customize</span> feature affects only the <tt
class="FILENAME">_emacs</tt> file of the current user, we will make
all configuration changes in this file throughout the whole
tutorial. To turn this file into a system-wide configuration file,
it is sufficient to move the contents or part of the contents from
this file to your <tt class="FILENAME">site-lisp.el</tt> or <tt
class="FILENAME">default.el</tt> afterwards.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As <span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span> reads the startup
files only at startup, it is necessary to reload them after they
were changed. The least elegant but safest way to do this is to
restart <span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Due to its Unix heritage, <span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span>
accepts and sometimes expects path denominators in Unix style with
forward slashes instead of the DOS-style backslashes. If you use
backslashes in Emacs Lisp, be aware that this is a special
character. You'll need two consecutive backslashes in DOS-style
paths.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Also due to its Unix heritage, <span class=
"APPLICATION">Emacs</span> relies on the presence of a <tt class=
"ENVAR">HOME</tt> environment variable which denotes the home
directory of the current user. This may be any valid path that the
user has write access to, including directories on network drives.
When typing in paths, e.g. upon loading a file, the home directory
can be abbreviated as <tt class="FILENAME">~/</tt>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span> uses major and minor
modes (defined in an <tt class="FILENAME">.el</tt>/<tt class=
"FILENAME">.elc</tt> file or in a set of such files) to add
functionality which is not present by default.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Emacs Lisp source files (<tt class="FILENAME">.el</tt>) can
be byte-compiled (<tt class="FILENAME">.elc</tt>) to increase the
speed of execution. To minimize the archive size, the <span class=
"APPLICATION">NTEmacs</span> distribution contains only the
byte-compiled versions. To modify the code or to learn from the
code, you will have to download the sources separately.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Instead of dialog boxes <span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span>
uses the minibuffer (the last line in the <span class=
"APPLICATION">Emacs</span> frame) to display messages and to enter
commands. This command-line shows many features of the Bash (a
common Unix shell), e.g. completion with the tab key and a sort of
an argument history.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Although NTEmacs is no CygWin application, there are (not quite
unexpectedly) some pieces of code that allow NTEmacs to understand
the CygWin mount table and to follow CygWin symlinks.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It is certainly possible to use bash or any other Unix shell of
your choice in an Emacs shell buffer.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> I don't want to stir up the almost religious
controversy between the GNU Emacs supporters and the XEmacs
supporters. I use GNU Emacs because it is simply my very personal
preference. Nevertheless I would like to mention that XEmacs builds
as a CygWin application, in contrast to NTEmacs. If you prefer to
use a native CygWin application as your editor, then go get the <a
href="http://www.xemacs.org" target="_top">XEmacs</a> sources and
be aware that you may have to change some of the instructions below
to work with this editor.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Gnuserv is a small utility which greatly simplifies the use of
<span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span>. If you associate file types
with <span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span>, each double-click on
an associated file will start a new copy of the editor, thus
wasting time and memory. Gnuserv allows to open such files in a
running copy of <span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span>, and it will
create a new frame for the file if you wish so.</p>

<p>Although not directly related to <span class=
"APPLICATION">Emacs</span>, we will also install <span class=
"APPLICATION">Ghostscript</span> (a PostScript interpreter) and
<span class="APPLICATION">Ghostview</span> (a graphical frontend
for <span class="APPLICATION">Ghostscript</span> including a
previewer) at this point. These tools are useful to preview
PostScript documents and print them on non-PostScript printers. We
need this feature in this and the following chapters to view or
print useful help files. At a later stage you will be able to
create PostScript documents from your SGML source documents.</p>
