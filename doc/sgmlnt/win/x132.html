variables</a></h1>

<p>Environment variables are used by many programs to read in
additional information at startup. E.g. the <tt class=
"ENVAR">PATH</tt> environment variable tells the shell where to
look for executables, thus allowing you to run many programs
without having to specify the full path of the binary.</p>

<p><span class="APPLICATION">Windows NT</span> knows two types of
environment variables: System variables can be changed only by the
administrator and affect all users, whereas user variables affect
only the user who set them for his own environment. Both are set in
the System applet of the System settings group. Select the
"Environment" tab in the pop-up dialog and click on the entry that
you want to edit. The present value of the variable will be
displayed in a separate edit field. Change the value or append new
values to the semicolon-separated list. Click <span class=
"GUIBUTTON">Set</span> (clicking <span class="GUIBUTTON">OK</span>
alone is not sufficient). To create a new environment variable,
enter a new name into the provided edit field, and set a value as
described above.</p>

<p>For <span class="APPLICATION">Emacs</span> as well as for
command line windows, the environment variables are evaluated only
once: when the window is opened first. If you change environment
variables as described, they will have no effect on command line
windows that are already open. So to see the effects of added or
changed environment variables, you'll have to close and reopen any
command line windows.</p>

<p>On <span class="APPLICATION">Windows 95/98/ME</span>, all
environment variables are set in the <tt class=
"FILENAME">autoexec.bat</tt> file with an entry like <b class=
"COMMAND">set VARIABLE=VALUE</b>. You will have to reboot the
computer to let the changes take effect.</p>
